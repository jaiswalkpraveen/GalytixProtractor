# Galytix QA Exercise
Here is the test plan : https://bit.ly/30lIxYE
For now, I have only wrote automated script for positive scenario due to time constraints.

# Instructions:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

Checkout or download the code, then install the Angular CLI, and do:

`npm install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
